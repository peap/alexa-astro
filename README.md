# Pluto the Astronomer
Ask your Amazon Echo about the night sky!

## Locations
What you see in the sky depends on where you are.

Ask where Pluto thinks you are:
> Alexa, ask Pluto for my location.
> 
> I have Austin, Texas as your current location.

Update your location:
> Alexa, tell Pluto to change my location to Seattle.
> Alexa, tell Pluto that I'm in Seattle, Washington.
> 
> Your location has been updated to Seattle, Washington.

Be more specific:
> Alexa, tell Pluto that my latitude is 43 degrees and 12 minutes.
> 
> Your latitude has been updated.

> Alexa, tell Pluto that my longitude is 100 degrees and 12 minutes west.
> 
> Your longitude has been updated.

## What's in the Sky?
Open the Pluto skill, or ask what's visible, to get a summary of what you
can see in the sky right now:

> Alexa, open Pluto.
> 
> This is Pluto the Astronomer. Currently, from Seattle, you can see the Moon,
> Jupiter, and Venus.

Or ask about another time:

> Alexa, ask Pluto what we'll see tonight.
> 
> Tonight, you can expect to see the Moon, Jupiter, and Venus.

## Where is something?
Ask Pluto where something is in the sky:

> Alexa, ask Pluto where Jupiter is.
> 
> Jupiter is at an altitude of 38 degrees, with an azimuth of 222 degrees.

Wait, what?

> Alexa, ask Pluto about azimuth.
> 
> The azimuth of an object is the angle between due north and its location
> projected down to the horizon. For objects that are due north, the azimuth is
> zero degrees, due east is 90 degrees, due south is 180 degrees, and due west
> is 270 degrees.

And altitude?

> Alexa, ask Pluto about altitude.
> 
> The altitude of an object is the angle between the horizon and its height in
> the sky. An object that is just rising or setting has an altitude of zero
> degrees, and an object directly overhead has an altitude of 90 degrees.

## When will something rise/set?

> Alexa, ask Pluto when Jupiter will rise.
> 
> Jupiter will rise around 3:40 AM.

> Alexa, ask Pluto when Jupiter will set.
> 
> Jupiter will set around 6:00 AM.

## What am I looking at?
What's that bright light in the sky?

> Alexa, ask Pluto what I'm seeing at 200 degrees azimuth and 35 degrees
> altitude.
> 
> You might be seeing Jupiter, which is at 220 degrees azimuth and 40 degrees
> altitude.
